Yoctopuce library for JavaScript (DEPRECATED)
====================================

**Important: this is an old version of Yoctopuce library for
Javascript (using synchronous XMLHttpRequests).**
It has been preserved to avoid breaking dependencies, but is not any more updated.
We recommend using the [TypeScript](https://github.com/yoctopuce/yoctolib_ts) version, 
which has full support for asynchronous I/O, implements more efficient HTTP requests and
includes WebSocket support. The TypeScript library includes pure JavaScript files
transpiled from TypeScript, ready to use in the `dist/` subdirectory
